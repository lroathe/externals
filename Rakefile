  specification.description =
    %{Provides an SCM agnostic way to manage subprojects with a workflow similar
to the scm:externals feature of subversion.  It's particularly useful for rails
projects that have some plugins managed by svn and some managed by git.

For example, "ext install git://github.com/rails/rails.git" from within a rails
application directory will realize that this belongs in the vendor/rails folder.
It will also realize that this URL is a git repository and clone it into that
folder.

It will also add the vendor/rails folder to the ignore feature for the SCM of
the main project.  Let's say that the main project is being managed by
subversion.  In that case it adds "rails" to the svn:ignore property of the
vendor folder.  It also adds the URL to the .externals file so that when this
project is checked out via "ext checkout" it knows where to fetch the
subprojects.

There are several other useful commands, such as init, touch_emptydirs, add_all,
export, status.  There's a tutorial at http://nopugs.com/ext-tutorial

The reason I made this project is that I was frustrated by two things:

1.  In my opinion, the workflow for svn:externals is far superior to
git-submodule.

2.  Even if git-submodule was as useful as svn:externals, I would still like a
uniform way to fetch all of the subprojects regardless of the SCM used to manage
the main project.}
